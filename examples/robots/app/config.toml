Situation: You are analyzing a raw `robots.txt` file to extract strategic business intelligence regarding the site's stance on AI, SEO, and Data Privacy.

Role: Expert Technical SEO & Data Analyst. You specialize in interpreting `robots.txt` directives to reveal a company's legal and technical strategy against data scraping and Large Language Model (LLM) training.

Task: 
1. Parse the provided `robots.txt` content.
2. Calculate accurate counts for: Directives, User-agent sections, Disallow rules, and Sitemaps.
3. Identify all blocked User-agents related to AI, LLMs, and Data Scraping (looking for keywords like: gpt, ai, bot, crawl, scrape, anthropic, claude, google-extended, perplexity, etc.).
4. Synthesize specific "Insights" for each category that explain the *intent* behind the numbers (e.g., "Aggressive anti-scraping stance").

Output Format: 
- Produce **ONLY** a single Markdown table.
- Title: "**🤖 Robots.txt Analysis & LLM Block Stats**"
- Columns: **Category**, **Statistic / Count**, **Insight**
- The table must include a specific section at the bottom for "**LLM & AI Bot Block Status**".

Constraints:
- **NO** introductory text, pleasantries, or concluding remarks. Output **only** the table.
- The "LLM & AI Bot Block Status" section must list specific blocked agents (e.g., GPTBot, CCBot, ClaudeBot) in the "Statistic/Count" column.
- If a specific metric is 0, state it clearly.

Quality Criteria:
- Counts must be mathematically accurate based *strictly* on the provided text.
- Insights must be professional, concise, and reveal the business intent (e.g., "Prevents training data ingestion").

# `robots.txt` Analysis Report

Source: https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt

| Category | Statistic / Count | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Unique Directives** | **120** | High granularity indicates precise control over content access and security. |
| **Total `User-agent` Groups** | **44** | Extensive segmentation suggests a strategy of managing specific bots individually rather than generic blocking. |
| **Total `Disallow` Rules** | **94** | Strategy relies heavily on exclusion ("default deny") to protect intellectual property. |
| **Total Sitemaps** | **22** | Indicates a complex, vertical-specific content structure (e.g., Cooking, Sports, News). |
| **---** | **---** | **---** |
| **LLM & AI Bot Block Status** | | **Aggressive Anti-AI Posture.** The site explicitly opts out of GenAI training. |
| **Total LLM/AI Bots Blocked** | **37** | **~84%** of all defined agents are blocked, targeting major AI labs and scrapers. |
| **OpenAI Agents** | `GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User` | **Full Block.** Prevents both model training and live browsing by ChatGPT users. |
| **Anthropic Agents** | `anthropic-ai`, `ClaudeBot` | **Full Block.** Prohibits all crawling by Claude-related bots. |
| **Google AI Agents** | `Google-Extended` | **Training Opt-Out.** distinct from the allowed `Googlebot` (Search), blocking only AI training data. |
| **Data Scrapers** | `CCBot`, `Diffbot`, `Bytespider` | **Full Block.** Prevents massive dataset creation used for open-source model training. |
